## Task Manager App

"Task Manager App" is a powerful task management Android mobile application developed using 
the Kotlin language. This app can add tasks with different levels of importance like 'Important', 'To 
Do', or 'Meeting.' Each task can be marked as 'Pending', 'In Progress', or 'Done.' The app shows your 
pending tasks by priority on the home screen. Using this app, you can also search for tasks by date 
and see what you're currently working on or what you've completed.  You can easily add, update, or 
delete tasks whenever you need to.
